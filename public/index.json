	"content": "AWS Backup enables you to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services. AWS Backup offers a cost-effective, fully managed, policy-based service that simplifies data protection at scale. AWS Backup helps you support your regulatory compliance obligations and meet your business continuity goals.\nBy using AWS Backup, you get the following benefits:\nCan create backup policies called backup plans. Can use these plans to define your backup requirements, such as how frequently to back up your data and how long to retain those backups. AWS Backup lets you apply backup plans to your AWS resources by simply tagging them. This lab will perform AWS Backup with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. When using AWS Backup with Amazon EC2 instances, you can centralize your compliance and policy control for backups, increase security choices for your organization, and access instant enterprise-level features and functionality.\nWith the above advantages, you can use AWS Backup to store resources and restore it when you have problems with your data.
